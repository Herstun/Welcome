Welcome to CSC 230-01 - Elementary Data Structures

Greetings Scholars,

It is my pleasure to be your instructor for **CSC 230 Elementary Data Structures at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Greensboro**. In this GitHub Classroom I will post the following:

* *assignments*
* *in-class activities* 

You will work individually or either in assigned groups to not only learn about git/github but also to learn how to work collaboratively. GitHub is a real world tool that you may use in the future as software engineer/developer. Using this application will also allow you to showcase your work and abilities. The very first thing I would like you to do is create your very own octocat (https://myoctocat.com).

I'll share mine first!

I look forward to seeing the great work that you will complete this semester!


Happy Coding!

Dr. Day
